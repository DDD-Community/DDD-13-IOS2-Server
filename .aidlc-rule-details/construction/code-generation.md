# Code Generation - Detailed Steps

## Overview
This stage generates code for each unit of work through two integrated parts:
- **Part 1 - Planning**: Create detailed code generation plan with explicit steps
- **Part 2 - Generation**: Execute approved plan to generate code, tests, and artifacts

**Note**: For brownfield projects, "generate" means modify existing files when appropriate, not create duplicates.

## MANDATORY: Extension Workflow Check
Before proceeding, check `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` under `## Extension Configuration` for any enabled extensions that replace this workflow. If an extension with Code Generation workflow replacement is enabled (e.g., TDD Code Generation), load and follow that extension's workflow rules instead of this file. The extension file will include a per-unit applicability check — if the extension is skipped for a specific unit, return to this file for that unit.

## Prerequisites
- Unit Design Generation must be complete for the unit
- NFR Implementation (if executed) must be complete for the unit
- All unit design artifacts must be available
- Unit is ready for code generation

# PART 1: PLANNING

## Step 1: Analyze Unit Context
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Read `aidlc-docs/construction/review/{fc-name}/erd.md` — 테이블명, 컬럼명, 관계를 이 파일 기준으로 따른다. 사용자가 ERD를 직접 수정했을 경우 수정된 내용이 코드에 반영되어야 한다.
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Read `aidlc-docs/construction/review/{fc-name}/rules.md` — 비즈니스 규칙 확인
- [ ] Read unit design artifacts from Unit Design Generation
- [ ] Read unit story map to understand assigned stories
- [ ] Identify unit dependencies and interfaces
- [ ] Validate unit is ready for code generation

## Step 2: Create Detailed Unit Code Generation Plan
- [ ] Read workspace root and project type from `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`
- [ ] Determine code location (see Critical Rules for structure patterns)
- [ ] **Brownfield only**: Review reverse engineering code-structure.md for existing files to modify
- [ ] Document exact paths (never aidlc-docs/)
- [ ] Create explicit steps for unit generation:
  - Project Structure Setup (greenfield only)
  - Business Logic Generation
  - Business Logic Unit Testing
  - Business Logic Summary
  - API Layer Generation
  - API Layer Unit Testing
  - API Layer Summary
  - Repository Layer Generation
  - Repository Layer Unit Testing
  - Repository Layer Summary
  - Frontend Components Generation (if applicable)
  - Frontend Components Unit Testing (if applicable)
  - Frontend Components Summary (if applicable)
  - Database Migration Scripts (if data models exist)
  - Documentation Generation (API docs, README updates)
  - Deployment Artifacts Generation
- [ ] Number each step sequentially
- [ ] Include story mapping references
- [ ] Add checkboxes [ ] for each step

## Step 3: Include Unit Generation Context
- [ ] For this unit, include:
  - Stories implemented by this unit
  - Dependencies on other units/services
  - Expected interfaces and contracts
  - Database entities owned by this unit
  - Service boundaries and responsibilities

## Step 4: Create Unit Plan Document
- [ ] Save complete plan as `aidlc-docs/construction/internal/plans/{unit-name}-code-generation-plan.md`
- [ ] Include step numbering (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- [ ] Include unit context and dependencies
- [ ] Include story traceability
- [ ] Ensure plan is executable step-by-step
- [ ] Emphasize that this plan is the single source of truth for Code Generation

## Step 5: Summarize Unit Plan
- [ ] Provide summary of the unit code generation plan to the user
- [ ] Highlight unit generation approach
- [ ] Explain step sequence and story coverage
- [ ] Note total number of steps and estimated scope

## Step 6: Log Approval Prompt
- [ ] Before asking for approval, log the prompt with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
- [ ] Include reference to the complete unit code generation plan
- [ ] Use ISO 8601 timestamp format

## Step 7: Wait for Explicit Approval
- [ ] Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the unit code generation plan
- [ ] Approval must cover the entire plan and generation sequence
- [ ] If user requests changes, update the plan and repeat approval process

## Step 8: Record Approval Response
- [ ] Log the user's approval response with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
- [ ] Include the exact user response text
- [ ] Mark the approval status clearly

## Step 9: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark Code Generation Part 1 (Planning) complete in `aidlc-state.md`
- [ ] Update the "Current Status" section
- [ ] Prepare for transition to Code Generation

---

# PART 2: GENERATION

## Step 10: Load Unit Code Generation Plan
- [ ] Read the complete plan from `aidlc-docs/construction/internal/plans/{unit-name}-code-generation-plan.md`
- [ ] Identify the next uncompleted step (first [ ] checkbox)
- [ ] Load the context for that step (unit, dependencies, stories)

## Step 11: Execute Current Step
- [ ] Verify target directory from plan (never aidlc-docs/)
- [ ] **Brownfield only**: Check if target file exists
- [ ] Generate exactly what the current step describes:
  - **If file exists**: Modify it in-place (never create `ClassName_modified.java`, `ClassName_new.java`, etc.)
  - **If file doesn't exist**: Create new file
- [ ] Write to correct locations:
  - **Application Code**: Workspace root per project structure
  - **Documentation**: `aidlc-docs/construction/internal/{unit-name}/code/` (markdown only)
  - **Build/Config Files**: Workspace root
- [ ] Follow unit story requirements
- [ ] Respect dependencies and interfaces

## Step 12: Update Progress
- [ ] Mark the completed step as [x] in the unit code generation plan
- [ ] Mark associated unit stories as [x] when their generation is finished
- [ ] Update `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md` current status
- [ ] **Brownfield only**: Verify no duplicate files created (e.g., no `ClassName_modified.java` alongside `ClassName.java`)
- [ ] Save all generated artifacts

## Step 13: Continue or Complete Generation
- [ ] If more steps remain, return to Step 10
- [ ] If all steps complete, generate Review API doc (Step 13.5), then proceed to present completion message

## Step 13.5: Generate Review API Doc (MANDATORY)
**CRITICAL**: Every unit with API endpoints MUST generate this review artifact.

- 경로: `aidlc-docs/construction/review/{fc-name}/api.md`
- **모든 엔드포인트 포함** — HTTP method, URL, 인증 여부, 요청 body, 응답 body
- **요청/응답 예시 필수** — JSON 형태로 실제 예시 값 포함
- **에러 케이스 포함** — 각 API에서 발생 가능한 에러코드와 HTTP 상태코드

**API 명세 포맷 (반드시 준수)**:
```
## POST /api/v1/{path}

**인증**: JWT 필수 / 불필요
**권한**: 호스트만 / 구성원만 / 본인만 / 없음

### 요청
json
{
  "field": "타입 — 설명, 제약사항"
}

### 응답 (201 Created)
json
{
  "field": "값 예시"
}

### 에러
| 상태코드 | 에러코드 | 발생 조건 |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | GROUP_NAME_TOO_LONG | 이름 30자 초과 |
```

## Step 14: Present Completion Message
- Present completion message in this structure:
     1. **Completion Announcement** (mandatory): Always start with this:

```markdown
# 💻 Code Generation Complete - [unit-name]
```

     2. **AI Summary** (optional): Provide structured bullet-point summary
        - **Brownfield**: Distinguish modified vs created files (e.g., "• Modified: `src/services/user-service.ts`", "• Created: `src/services/auth-service.ts`")
        - **Greenfield**: List created files with paths (e.g., "• Created: `src/services/user-service.ts`")
        - List tests, documentation, deployment artifacts with paths
        - Keep factual, no workflow instructions
     3. **Formatted Workflow Message** (mandatory): Always end with this exact format:

```markdown
> **📋 <u>**REVIEW REQUIRED:**</u>**  
> Please examine the generated code at:
> - **Application Code**: `[actual-workspace-path]`
> - **Documentation**: `aidlc-docs/construction/[unit-name]/code/`



> **🚀 <u>**WHAT'S NEXT?**</u>**
>
> **You may:**
>
> 🔧 **Request Changes** - Ask for modifications to the generated code based on your review  
> ✅ **Continue to Next Stage** - Approve code generation and proceed to **[next-unit/Build & Test]**

---
```

## Step 15: Wait for Explicit Approval
- Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the generated code
- Approval must be clear and unambiguous
- If user requests changes, update the code and repeat the approval process

## Step 16: Record Approval and Update Progress
- Log approval in audit.md with timestamp
- Record the user's approval response with timestamp
- Mark Code Generation stage as complete for this unit in aidlc-state.md

---

## Critical Rules

### Code Location Rules
- **Application code**: Workspace root only (NEVER aidlc-docs/)
- **Documentation**: aidlc-docs/ only (markdown summaries)
- **Read workspace root** from aidlc-state.md before generating code

**Structure patterns by project type**:
- **Brownfield**: Use existing structure (e.g., `src/main/java/`, `lib/`, `pkg/`)
- **Greenfield single unit**: `src/`, `tests/`, `config/` in workspace root
- **Greenfield multi-unit (microservices)**: `{unit-name}/src/`, `{unit-name}/tests/`
- **Greenfield multi-unit (monolith)**: `src/{unit-name}/`, `tests/{unit-name}/`

### Swagger 네이밍 규칙 (Spring Boot)

**@Tag**
- `name`: 컨텍스트명 + 핵심 기능 목록 — 보는 사람이 어떤 API가 있는지 즉시 알 수 있어야 함
- `description`: 이 태그에 속한 API가 하는 일을 한 줄로 설명
- BAD: `@Tag(name = "그룹")`
- GOOD: `@Tag(name = "그룹", description = "그룹 생성 · 초대 코드 발급 · 구성원 관리")`

**@Operation**
- `summary`: **동사 + 목적어** 형태, 이 엔드포인트가 하는 일을 명확하게
- `description`: 요청/응답에서 중요한 동작이 있으면 한 줄 보충 설명
- BAD: `summary = "그룹 생성"`
- GOOD: `summary = "그룹 & 첫 모임 생성 — 이름·테마 입력 시 그룹/모임/호스트 멤버십 동시 생성"`

### Brownfield File Modification Rules
- Check if file exists before generating
- If exists: Modify in-place (never create copies like `ClassName_modified.java`)
- If doesn't exist: Create new file
- Verify no duplicate files after generation (Step 12)

### Planning Phase Rules
- Create explicit, numbered steps for all generation activities
- Include story traceability in the plan
- Document unit context and dependencies
- Get explicit user approval before generation

### Generation Phase Rules
- **NO HARDCODED LOGIC**: Only execute what's written in the unit plan
- **FOLLOW PLAN EXACTLY**: Do not deviate from the step sequence
- **UPDATE CHECKBOXES**: Mark [x] immediately after completing each step
- **STORY TRACEABILITY**: Mark unit stories [x] when functionality is implemented
- **RESPECT DEPENDENCIES**: Only implement when unit dependencies are satisfied

### Automation Friendly Code Rules
When generating UI code (web, mobile, desktop), ensure elements are automation-friendly:
- Add `data-testid` attributes to interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links, forms)
- Use consistent naming: `{component}-{element-role}` (e.g., `login-form-submit-button`, `user-list-search-input`)
- Avoid dynamic or auto-generated IDs that change between renders
- Keep `data-testid` values stable across code changes (only change when element purpose changes)

## Completion Criteria
- Complete unit code generation plan created and approved
- All steps in unit code generation plan marked [x]
- All unit stories implemented according to plan
- All code and tests generated (tests will be executed in Build & Test phase)
- Deployment artifacts generated
- Complete unit ready for build and verification
